  <p>The one, the only, the league.</p>
  <p>Going into Year 4, we have only one team that has tasted the glory that comes with being a champion.</p>
  <p>Chase'n the Future runs this league. The 3-time back-to-back-to-back champion has shown everyone else no mercy in his construction of a perfect dynasty.</p>
  <p>The rest of us have been taking notes, working diligently to position each of our teams to be the one to take down the king. Meanwhile, our resident league villain has been basking in his victories while keeping a keen eye on the defense of his crown. There are no days off at the top.</p>
  <p>With some great rivalries set to battle, it'll be interesting to see how everything plays out. Lots of teams are at different stages yet once we kick-off, only one can win.</p>
  <p>Will this be the year it all changes? I'm ready to find out.</p>
